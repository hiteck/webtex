Transcription of the central TeX source surrounding math layout. There's a lot
of subtle stuff going on and it's hard to test so I want to be careful about
the reimplementation.

The sketch-N.py files document progressive passes through the code, starting
out with a non-running but faithful transcription of TeX: The Program, then
reorganizing and clarifying and adapting to the webtex implementation.
